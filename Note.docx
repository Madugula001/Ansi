--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: ansible is the executable for doing ad-hoc one-task
executions and ansible-playbook is the executable that will
process playbooks for orchestrating many tasks.

When ansible or ansible-playbook is directed at an executable file for an
inventory source, Ansible will execute that script with a single argument, --list.
This is so that Ansible can get a listing of the entire inventory in order to build up
its internal objects to represent the data. Once that data is built up, Ansible will then
execute the script with a different argument for every host in the data to discover
variable data. The argument used in this execution is --host <hostname>, which
will return any variable data specific to that host.
